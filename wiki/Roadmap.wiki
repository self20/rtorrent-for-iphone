Proposed roadmap going forward with rtorrent for iPhone/smartphones - Any and all feedback much appreciated


= Proposed Features =

  * This project uses code "borrowed" from rTWi (see http://rtwi.jmk.hu/wiki) - Clarify the status on whether that is cool or not, and maybe look into cleaning up that codebase and making it more specific for our purpose.

* Rename the project so it isn't so platform specific? After all, it should work well with all capable smartphones

* Switch to jquerymobile when that thing finally gets released in a stable version

* Filtering options. Show all active torrents. Show all torrents with the TV label

* Manipulation: pause, resume, delete, etc. 

* Verify URL's added and warn if it doesn't look like a .torrent  (Curl - check headers/extension)

* Fix form submit so that you can use the iPhone keyboard to submit

* Hunt down JS error when hitting refresh

* Investigate further the possibility of not using the download to watchfolder approach

* Statistics (possibly using the FLOT jquery plugin)
